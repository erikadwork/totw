            People often throw out items without giving a second thought. When
            looking at what some people consider “trash” can be really
            interesting to look or analyze over. You may find hidden narratives
            of the owner’s life. With this idea, I decided to record and share
            my trash to allow myself to take some time to analyze the things I
            discard without thinking about it. I believe that by recording these
            wastes, I will begin to realize things about myself that I did not
            know or thought deeply about.

            I was inspired by other people that were also curious about trash
            and waste such as Sarah Newman and Brian Thill. I've come to see
            that each piece of waste is not simply an object rendered useless,
            but a signifier of the choices we make. Sarah Newman reminds us that
            what we dismiss as “junk” can be rethought as an old culture’s
            memory. She adds on how many folks believe archeology is the
            “science of rubbish” due to the belief that all the things left
            behind were unwanted or invaluable, when really some were actually
            valuable and served purpose. Newman believes that everyday discarded
            items have both beauty and personal meaning. If we pay close
            attention to them, they can show us parts of our social and
            emotional lives. She sees trash not as something to throw away, but
            shows how our values change over time. Brian Thill's ideas on
            consumer culture have helped me see how waste connects to our
            identity. He believes that the things we buy and then throw away
            reflect our inner priorities and social trends. Even everyday
            discarded items can reveal larger cultural and economic patterns. In
            his view, throwing things away quietly criticizes a system that
            often values convenience over thoughtful choices.

            While recognizing the hidden stories and sentimental value in our
            "trash" can offer deep insights into who we are, there’s a risk in
            overthinking it. Focusing too much on every discarded item might
            lead some to hoard, turning these treasures into burdens rather than
            meaningful reflections. This hoarding not only creates personal
            clutter that can affect mental well-being but also contributes to
            environmental harm through the accumulation of unnecessary items.
            The article <em><strong><a
                        href="https://www.twincitieshoardingcleanup.com/blog/how-hoarding-relates-to-climate-change#:~:text=As%20hoarders%20accumulate%20more%20possessions,and%20contribute%20to%20climate%20change">"How Hoarding Relates to Climate Change"</a></strong></em>
            explains that there’s a downside to overvaluing every discarded
            item. When we start to see trash as a collection of personal
            history, it can lead to hoarding. An excessive accumulation of
            possessions and items that not only clutters our lives but also has
            serious environmental consequences. Excessive hoarding demands more
            space, drives higher energy use, and increases resource consumption,
            all of which contribute to climate change. Balancing our
            appreciation for these hidden stories with a mindful approach to
            consumption is key to protecting both our well-being and the planet.

            It can be a bittersweet experience to let go of items that once held
            significant value, as they carry memories of who we were and what we
            cherished. But don’t worry! Because this sense of loss can be
            transformed into a creative and great outlet. Instead of discarding
            these items as mere waste, we have the opportunity to reimagine and
            repurpose them into art. By doing so, we not only honor the past
            embodied in these objects but also give them a renewed purpose,
            turning what was once forgotten into a vibrant expression of
            creativity and sustainability. For example, this has been done by a
            plastic removal website. This page shows a variety of people’s
            recycled plastic trash turned into beautiful art. While helping the
            reduction of plastic for the environment, they have also created
            these amazing pieces. <em><strong><a

            After learning and reading about these studies on trash, I have
            decided to make my project about more personal reflection with a
            broader social message to everyone out there. Each item I record
            acts as a small piece of a larger picture that shows my individual
            behavior and overall social trends from the outside world. However,
            over time these pieces might reveal changes in our habits, hidden
            preferences, and shifts in personal values. For example, changing
            brands for certain items. However, it is important to acknowledge
            what items are not as valuable to us and although they hold bright
            memories, sometimes they must be let go. Each piece of trash tells a
            story. This could be a broken gadget that signifies a hobby or
            interest, packaging that hints at dietary choices or favorite
            brands, or everyday items that reveal routines and habits. By
            categorizing and analyzing these items, patterns may emerge that
            highlight underlying behaviors or shifts in personal priorities over
            time. This allows us to get a deeper understanding of ourselves and
            I believe that is important for everyone.

            Inspired by voices like Newman and Thill, I see these remnants not
            merely as trash, but as pieces of a larger mosaic that capture our
            evolving values. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between
            appreciating these sentimental items and overvaluing them, risking
            hoarding and its environmental consequences. By recording and
            repurposing what we discard, we honor our past while encouraging
            responsible, sustainable consumption.
