        <p>People often throw out items without giving a second thought. When
            looking at what some people consider “waste” can be really
            interesting to look or analyze over. For example, looking at a
            discarded packaging tells you what items they may enjoy or maybe
            even their hobbies. With this idea, I decided to record and share my
            trash to allow myself to take some time to analyze the things I
            discard without thinking about it. I believe that by recording these
            wastes, I will begin to realize things about myself that I did not
            know or thought deeply about. And I believe sharing this with others
            can allow me to know if my theory is correct that you can tell a lot
            about someone’s character from their trash.<br> <br>Expanding on
            this concept, the act of recording discarded items can serve as a
            mirror reflecting various facets of one's lifestyle, preferences,
            and even values. Each piece of trash tells a story. This could be a
            broken gadget that signifies a hobby or interest, packaging that
            hints at dietary choices or favorite brands, or everyday items that
            reveal routines and habits. By categorizing and analyzing these
            items, patterns may emerge that highlight underlying behaviors or
            shifts in personal priorities over time. This allows us to get a
            deeper understanding of ourselves and I believe that is important
            for everyone. </p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <a href="#">Back to Top</a>

        <p>Over the time of collecting a daily piece of trash, I have begun to
            notice how much I go through my daily items. Items such as my empty
            face wash tube or my conditioner bottle have made me realize I use
            these products quite often and repurchase them without a thought.
            With this idea, it has made me realize where my money is being
            placed without me thinking about it. I had always had the belief
            that I did not purchase a lot of leisure items, but seeing how fast
            I have gone through these products, tells me that I need to be more
            careful with how I use them. Another pattern I have noticed is how
            often I go through instant ramen. I have always had an idea of how
            much I consume the item, but seeing not only 1 but multiple packs go
            into the waste, has made me grow concerned at the amount I have been
            consuming. I have also taken notice of my friend’s supply, realizing
            mine disappearing much quicker than anyone I knew. This tells me I
            must be careful with how much I consume and must stop being lazy in
            cooking. <br><br>
            This project has so far been proving my theory correct, that it
            would tell me a lot about myself that I didn't give a second
            thought. However not only did it tell me things about myself, it
            brought back memories of the object. Whether it was something said
            about it in the past, or was used with a loved one a few days ago,
            it made me realize how something that people consider waste, holds a
            lot of memories. Based on everything I have learned and reminisced
            about, I have separated my trash of the week into 3 groups.

        </p>
        <h2 id="selfcare">Self care</h2>
        <p>The first group I have is self care items. This includes self care
            items such as an elf primer packaging, toner pads, an empty
            conditioner bottle and a face wash tube. Most of these items I had
            obtained by ordering online on amazon, however I had gotten the
            conditioner bottle from a store in nyc.</p>
        <h3><a
                href="https://www.elfcosmetics.com/power-grip-primer--4-niacinamide/81517.html">
                Primer </a> </h3>
        <p> Starting with the elf primer packaging, I had obtained this when
            realizing I had run out of my previous primer. It is a torn apart
            box due to me opening it roughly. I had gotten this new product
            because I had talked with some friends about products we could
            recommend to each other and one of them recommended this specific
            product. It was a pleasant talk with my female friends considering
            we often only talk about video games or shows</p>
        <h3><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_conditioner">Conditioner</a></h3>
        <p>The empty conditioner bottle is a big red rectangular container. A
            little dried piece of the conditioner hangs from the spout, showing
            the consistent usage of the product. I had gotten this product while
            out with friends in nyc, memories of walking around talking about
            what i heard about this brand was very fun. I enjoyed the product so
            much, but unfortunately I used it all.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanser">Face Wash</a></h3>
        <p> Similar to the conditioner bottle, I have an empty face wash tube. I
            have been using this product many times. I had come across it on
            social media, hearing it was affordable and worked well with dry
            skin. Hearing the great reviews, I had purchased it online and have
            been enjoying it (a little too much) since then. </p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toner_(skin_care)">Toner
                Pads</a></h3>
        <p>Finally the last item in the group is some used toner pads. They are
            thin rounded squares soaked. I also had heard great things about
            this brand and product and wanted to give them a try. One fond
            memory I have is when I had placed them on my face and walked over
            to my friend, who said I looked strange and scary. I then proceeded
            to put some on their faces as well. Unfortunately the item is not
            reusable so I must discard them after use.</p>

        <h2 id="lovedones">Shared with loved ones</h2>
        <p>My second group is objects I have shared with loved ones. This
            includes an empty instant ramen package and an empty water
            bottle.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buldak_Ramen">Instant ramen
                packet</a></h3>
        <p>The empty ramen package is a black thin plastic with red flames to
            demonstrate the spiciness of the product. I had gotten this item due
            to seeing my sister consuming the same brand. At a young age, I
            liked to try the same things my sister did. With this mentality, I
            decided to try this brand. I have many fond memories with this item.
            For example, the first time I tasted it, I nearly cried to my sister
            with how spicy it was while she laughed at me. Now I purchase this
            item online or in a supermarket. Another are the numerous times I
            had eaten instant ramen with my significant other late at night. As
            college students with no kitchen, we resorted to instant ramen to
            fill our midnight cravings. It was always a fond time eating this
            while watching our favorite show.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bottle">Water
                Bottle</a></h3>
        <p>Following along with this, my second item being an empty water
            bottle. It is a clear plastic bottle with some leftover water
            droplets inside. I retrieved this item from chugging it down after
            eating the spicy instant noodles. My significant other would
            constantly be stealing my water bottle and finishing them himself.
            We would jokingly argue on who steals more water than the other and
            would have to resort to buying a large amount of cases of water.</p>

        <h2 id="hoarding">Hoarding</h2>
        <p>My third group is items I had thought would come in handy but really
            didnt. This includes a black face mask, a blue ribbon, and a paper
            with written problems on it.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon">Ribbon</a></h3>
        <p> My next item is a blue ribbon I had gotten as part of a gift I was
            given. It is a thin baby blue ribbon with a triangular cut at the
            end. I believed the ribbon was a pretty shade of blue and was fond
            of ribbons in hair. I figured one day I could use it to tie my hair
            one day but never did so. I remember trying to tie my hair with it
            but failing miserably and getting frustrated with it. I had kept it
            in my desk for a long time and decided to finally get rid of it.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask">Face
                mask</a></h3>
        <p>The black mask is soft and slightly creased from me folding it in my
            bag. I had gotten this from a pack my mother gave to me before
            college. My nose often gets very red when it is cold out and I would
            sometimes try to use a mask to help prevent that from happening.
            However I often forget or feel awkward wearing it so it
            unfortunately ends up in my bag for a long period of time. It
            reminds me of the time of the covid pandemic when everybody would
            wear the mask and it was considered normal. I used to be insecure
            about my face so I actually was fond of the mask idea. I decided to
            discard this item since it had been sitting in my bag for too
            long.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worksheet">Scrap
                paper</a></h3>
        <p> Lastly I have a white scrap paper I used to write some practice
            problems on. I had used it while studying for one of my classes and
            figured I could possibly need it one day in the future. or even if
            one of my other friends would need it. Unfortunately I realized I
            would never look back on the sheet of people and decided it’s time
            to get rid of it. I remember the work was for my physics class and I
            had a tough time studying and understanding the material. The work
            done on this paper was the only material I felt confident in.

        <h2>Item of the Week</h2>
        <p>The item of this week is a piece of scrap paper I had written old
            practice physics problems on! I have decided to choose this item due
            to the fact I have been struggling with physics 2 recently. Looking
            back at the scrap paper reminds me of the nights I spent up late
            trying to understand the material with my friends.<br><br>Physics
            had always been a subject I struggled in and unfortunately had to
            take it to continue my bachelors of science in computer science (I
            did not want to take chemistry). Days, Weeks, Months I had spent not
            understanding the topics at all and was going into a mental spiral.
            Thankfully I had my friends help me through. They had kept my
            spirits high and continued to help me in understanding the concepts
            even when they were struggling as well. This is something I will
            always remember and be thankful for. Considering I had to take
            physics 2 I figured keeping these papers would do me some good, but
            sadly they were put in the pile of items I hoard.<br><br>Scrap paper
            and practice problems go back to when paper was first invented in
            ancient China around the 2nd century BCE. In the past, paper was
            made from items such as old rags and bark, and leftover sheets were
            used for quick notes or rough sketches, what we now call “scrap
            paper.” As papermaking spread and more people learned to read and
            write, teachers began creating simple practice questions to help
            students master new skills. Today, we still use scrap paper and
            practice problems for everything from math drills to brainstorming
            ideas, proving that sometimes the simplest tools can have a lasting
            impact on learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Coda</h2>
        <p>Thank you for keeping up with my journey of Trash of the Week!
            Analyzing these past items have brought a lot of memories and
            knowledge about myself I didn’t realize until now. I encourage you
            to try this yourself and take a minute or two to think about the
            sentimental value it had before it turned into “waste”. Maybe you’ll
            learn something new about yourself too or maybe a past memory will
            resurface!

        <h2>About The Author!</h2>
        <img src = "images/author.png" width = "200px">
        <p>Hi! My name is Erika and I am currently a student studying computer science.
            My goal is to go into the more creative side of computer science such as UI/UX and perhaps
            study further in the arts. However if money did not exist, I would love to own a bakery and a 
            flower shop! I have a strong interest in floriography (the language of flowers) and 
            am looking to make bouqets for people based on their meanings. In my down time I enjoy 
            doing art, playing video games and sleeping! I currently have been playing Minecraft,
            League of Legends and Hogwarts Legacy! I also enjoy having my head up in the clouds 
            and letting my imagination take control. So if you're interested in fantasy, anime and games,
            I hope you continue to follow my page!
