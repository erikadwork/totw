        <p>Hi! My name is Erika and I am currently a student studying computer
            science. My goal is to go into the more creative side of computer
            science such as UI/UX and perhaps study further in the arts.
            However, if money did not exist, I would love to own a bakery and a
            flower shop! Some little fun facts about me, my mbti is INFP, my
            hogwarts house is hufflepuff, I have a strong interest in
            floriography (the language of flowers) and am looking to make
            bouquets for people based on their meanings. I also enjoy collecting
            things such as figurines and other knick knacks. I especially adore
            ones that come in mystery boxes. The thrill of not knowing what I
            will get brings me a lot of joy when opening them. In my down time I
            enjoy doing art, playing video games and sleeping! I currently have
            been playing Minecraft, League of Legends and Hogwarts Legacy! I
            also enjoy having my head up in the clouds and letting my
            imagination take control. Fantasy ideas such as magic or medieval
            works gets me very excited and I love talking and hearing about
            them. If you're interested in fantasy, anime and games, I hope you
            continue to follow my page!
